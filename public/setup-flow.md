# ðŸ§­ Intelagent Chatbot Setup Flow Guide

This is the official setup logic followed by the Setup Agent. It defines the expected user steps and how the chatbot should respond.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Collect and confirm the user's domain
- Generate a unique site key for their chatbot
- Present the embed code using that key
- Store site key + domain in the database

---

## ðŸ§  Memory Keys Used

| Key                | Description                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `domain`           | User's provided website domain               |
| `domain_confirmed` | Boolean â€” has the user confirmed the domain? |
| `site_key`         | Unique key for their chatbot                 |

---

## âœ… Step 1: Greet the User

- Agent introduces itself as a Setup Agent
- Politely asks the user to provide their website domain (e.g., `mystore.com` or `mystore.myshopify.com`)

---

## âœ… Step 2: Confirm the Domain

- Agent repeats the submitted domain back to the user
- Waits for explicit confirmation (user must reply "yes" or similar)

---

## âœ… Step 3: Generate Site Key

- Once confirmed, the agent generates a placeholder site key
- The system automatically replaces this with a real, secure key
- The domain + site key are stored in the `site_keys` database table

---

## âœ… Step 4: Display Embed Code

- Agent shows the user their chatbot embed code:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.intelagent.chatbot/widget.js" data-site="[SITE_KEY]"></script>
```

- Explains how to install it (e.g., in the footer of their website before the closing `</body>` tag)

---

## âœ… Step 5: Offer Support

If the user has questions, the agent provides help with:
- Installation guidance
- Troubleshooting
- Where to paste the embed code

---

## ðŸ§  Behavior Summary

- If domain not stored â†’ Ask for domain
- If domain exists but not confirmed â†’ Ask for confirmation
- If user replies "yes" â†’ Generate key and show embed code
- If user replies "no" â†’ Ask again for the correct domain
- If both domain_confirmed and site_key exist â†’ Show embed code

---

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

The Setup Agent generates placeholder keys in the format `key_[16_random_chars]`. The system's Output Check node:
1. Detects when a key is being generated
2. Calls the Site Key Generator service
3. Replaces the placeholder with a real, unique key
4. Stores the key in the database

This approach ensures smooth conversation flow while maintaining security.

# 🧭 Intelagent Chatbot Setup Flow Guide

This is the official setup logic followed by the Setup Agent. It defines the expected user steps and how the chatbot should respond.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Collect and confirm the user’s domain
- Generate a unique `site_key`
- Present the embed code using that key
- Store `site_key` + `domain` securely via output

---

## 🧠 Memory Keys Used

| Key                | Description                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `domain`           | User’s provided website domain               |
| `domain_confirmed` | Boolean — has the user confirmed the domain? |
| `site_key`         | Secure, unique key for their chatbot         |

---

## ✅ Step 1: Greet the User

- Agent introduces itself as a Setup Agent
- Politely asks the user to provide their website domain (e.g., `mystore.com` or `mystore.myshopify.com`)

---

## ✅ Step 2: Confirm the Domain

- Agent repeats the submitted domain back to the user
- Waits for explicit confirmation (user must reply “yes”)

---

## ✅ Step 3: Generate Site Key

- Once confirmed, the agent triggers the `GenerateSiteKey` tool
- A secure, unique site key is generated (12–16 alphanumeric characters)
- The domain + site key are stored in the `site_keys` Postgres table

---

## ✅ Step 4: Display Embed Code

- Agent shows the user their chatbot embed code:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.intelagent.chatbot/widget.js" data-site="SITE_KEY_HERE"></script>
Explains how to install it (e.g., in theme.liquid or the footer of their website)

✅ Step 5: Offer Support
If the user has questions, the agent provides help with:

Resetting the setup

Troubleshooting

Where to paste the embed code

🧠 Behavior Summary
If domain not stored → Ask for domain

If domain exists but not confirmed → Ask for confirmation

If user replies “yes” → Confirm, generate key, and continue

If user replies “no” → Ask again

If both domain_confirmed and site_key exist → Show embed code
